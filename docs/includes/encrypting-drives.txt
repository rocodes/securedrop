   Like all storage media associated with SecureDrop, this drive should be
   encrypted and protected with a secure passphrase. We recommend using the
   tools built into Tails to `encrypt the drive using LUKS <https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html>`__.

   If you are planning to use hardware RAID and/or hardware-based encryption,
   we recommend that you research Tails compatibility before a procurement
   decision.
